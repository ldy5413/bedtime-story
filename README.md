# Story Generator with Text-to-Speech

A Flask web application that generates stories and provides text-to-speech functionality using multiple TTS services.

My son likes to listen to story before he sleeps, especially with his mom's voice. So I created this app with standard google tts service first and implement voice clone function with f5 tts.

## Features

- Story generation with AI
- Multiple TTS services:
  - Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
  - F5 Text-to-Speech
- User authentication system
- Voice profile management
- Audio streaming
- Database integration for story storage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/story-generator.git
cd story-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up configuration:

```bash
cp config_template.py config.py
```

Edit config.py with your API keys and settings

## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
python run.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

Start the f5 tts server:

```bash
python f5tts_api.py
```

You need to install f5-tts first. For the installation of f5 tts, you can refer to the official[ f5 tts library](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

I have very limited knowledge about the frontend, so almost everything in the frontend is generated by cursor. The backend is also generated by cursor first and I review/modify/debug it. If anyone can help improve the frontend, I will appreciate it.
